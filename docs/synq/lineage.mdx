## Services


 

 

### RelationshipsService 
(synq.lineage.v1.RelationshipsService)

RelationshipsService allow management of relationships between entities. Relationships can
be created, updated, and deleted between 2 custom entities, or between a custom entity and Synq native entity.enum
There is no option to create relationships between 2 Synq native entities (dbt model, BI dashboard, etc.).

#### UpsertRelationships

UpsertRelationships ([UpsertRelationshipsRequest](#upsertrelationshipsrequest)) [UpsertRelationshipsResponse](#upsertrelationshipsresponse)

Create or update relationships between entities. If the relationship already exists, it will be updated, otherwise it will be created.

#### DeleteRelationships

DeleteRelationships ([DeleteRelationshipsRequest](#deleterelationshipsrequest)) [DeleteRelationshipsResponse](#deleterelationshipsresponse)

Delete relationships between entities. If the relationship does not exist, it will be ignored.

 
 

### LineageService 
(synq.lineage.v1.LineageService)

LineageService allows you to fetch:
* Entity level lineage from a starting point of one or more entities.
* Column Level lineage from a starting point of multiple columns of a single entity.

#### GetLineage

GetLineage ([GetLineageRequest](#getlineagerequest)) [GetLineageResponse](#getlineageresponse)
